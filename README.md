## _¿What is this about?_
OpenBB-8 is a part of the presentation named as *Equilibrio via magnetismo* (balance via magnetism, in spanish) which explains (as his name says) a great use of the magnetism to get things balanced. This project is still on development and will be updated when the time comes.
## _¿How it works?_
Please stay tuned to the [wiki](https://github.com/lordfriky/OpenBB-8/wiki) updates.
## _Do your own_
The material you need is not too difficult to get. You will need an HC-05 or similar (as HC-06 or even HM-10 to get iOS compatibility) for app comunication, an L293D driver for motor-controlling and the motors. You can find an image of the connections below or using the .fzz file on Fritzing.

To set up the Arduino board you just have to charge the code provided (the .ino file) with Arduino IDE before connecting everything else, nothing more. If you don't have it you can get it from the [Arduino page](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).

For more specific instructions, please reefer to the [wiki](https://github.com/lordfriky/OpenBB-8/wiki).

For letting me use his "Bronco Wars" song as a background music for the first app. [Here](https://open.spotify.com/track/7FQt5hgMTuhlvUms06b0oW?si=x3ozh1LBTqei23WEM3TcPQ)'s a Spotify link for the song and [here](https://www.facebook.com/broncowave/)'s his Facebook fanpage. Google doesn't let me upload this app to Play Store since they cannot verify the permission that Broncowave gave me and I didn't have the time to do something, so you can find it [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vvk3dMcRRRZtObCZGS_xWYPjvbmcSQy9/view?usp=sharing).
