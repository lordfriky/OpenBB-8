## _¿What is this about?_
OpenBB-8 is a part of the presentation named as *Equilibrio via magnetismo* (balance via magnetism, in spanish) which explains (as his name says) a great use of the magnetism to get things balanced. This project is still on development and will be updated when the time comes.
## Thanks
At this time, no one else but us has been supported the project, so this a placeholder just in case.
